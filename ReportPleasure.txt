1.	Request comes in to router with user id, function name, and args.
2.	Router finds user with said id, routes request to said user.
3.	User receives request, calls ReportPleasure.  This involves:
 - Asking Clich√© to create a new Snapshot
 - Calling updatePleasure.  Averages user's pleasureReports over the last five minutes, including the new one.  Return new userPleasure.
 - Forwarding the Snapshot, user id, funcname ReportPleasure and args reportedPleasure and userPleasure to the PleasurePursuer.
4.	PleasurePursuer calls ReportPleasure with userid, timestamp, and reportedPleasure.  This involves:
	- Calling pursuePleasure (with user, reportedPleasure, and userPleasure)
		- Calling pursuePleasure on the soundworld, actionworld, and timeperceptionworld, passing each one the reportedPleasure and userId and userPleasure
			- Actionworld:  if userPleasure is above um idk 0.5, repeat the user's most recent action, if it was over a minute ago.  Also if reportedPleasure is positive, register a new like for this user and actioncategory.  if userpleasure < 0.5, give user a new action from whatever category they most recently liked.
			- Soundworld (just call it, it'll change shit based on degree of severity)
